# X-Plane-Scenery
Scenery development for simulations, centered on X-Plane flight simulator
 
Being interested in simulations, I am occupied in the updating and development of scenery for X-Plane 10+. Scenery here is in various stages of development before being submitted to the Scenery Gateway. You are welcome to download, use and improve any objects ant location scenery her but at your own risk. No warranty is impied whatso ever and these sets.

## SpaceX Boca Chica Build and Launch Sites
The rapid development of both infra-structure and at the Boca Chica Texas sites has left both mapping and scenery lagging well behind the current details at the site. This project starts an ongoing process to keep current on a location I have been excitedly following nearly daily. The Scenery I update still lags far behind my enthusiasm but enjoy (with the usual disclainers) what I have completed so far. Due to the unique nature of the buildings and other structures etc., fidelity varies.

Although strictly not an airport, I have created X-Plane 11 scenery for this FAA Licenced / Designated spaceport in South Texas. The, "IATA ID" of the semi-fictious FAA recognised  facility is informally SX20. A zipped version of the mose uup to data installation is here along with supporting development metwerials.

The following are "fictitious" areas but the ferry dock is my proposed solotion to transporting the Super heavy andStarship tp a Sea Launch Platform which is a plan on record. The Use of the beach area is less doable for regulatory reasons of cource.

The platform I developed last September when the "Mary - Maria Pointer" @BocaChicaMaria1 spotted a platform being renovated in the ship canal. Your guess on the ultimate configuration is as good as mine, but here is one for fun.
